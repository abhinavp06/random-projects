# What
This is just a collection of my experiments and fun little projects.

I pick the most random problems and cool stuff I find on the internet and try to translate them to code.

Do note that efficiency or "clean" code really isn't the goal here. It's about building something.

# Project List

I usually have a "goal.md" file in each projects directory which explains my thought process. Go through that first before reading any project's code.
